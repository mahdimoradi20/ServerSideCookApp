# ServerSideCookApp

This is kind of a personal project. but becuase github don't allow us as iranian poeple to have private repository(and i really don't underestand why?! why being
iranian means that we can not have privacy? :)! ) so i used a public repository instead.
I know i can use another platforms :) but my project is not secret or somthing like that and i feel more comfortable to use github. so i just use it :)
and feel free if you want to contribute to this project. thanks.

This project is server side for an android application named CookApp that provides a lot of food recipes foor users. and provides
a web app for sending recipes to users and something like that.

just edit config.sample.py and change name to config.py then upload this files to server. for example you can use pythonanywhere.com as your server.

Sorry if my english wasn't good enough :)
